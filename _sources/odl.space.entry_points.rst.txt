entry_points
============

Entry points for adding more spaces to ODL using external packages.

External packages can add an implementation of `TensorSpace` by hooking
into the setuptools entry point ``'odl.space'`` and exposing the methods
``tensor_space_impl`` and ``tensor_space_impl_names``.

This is used with functions such as `rn`, `cn`, `tensor_space` or
`uniform_discr` in order to allow arbitrary implementations.
