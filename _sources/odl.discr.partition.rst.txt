partition
=========

Partitons of interval products based on rectilinear grids.

A partition of a set is a finite collection of nonempty, pairwise
disjoint subsets whose union is the original set. The partitions
considered here are based on hypercubes, i.e. the tensor products
of partitions of intervals.
