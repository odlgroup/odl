Extending ODL
#############

ODL is written to be easy to extend with new functionality and classes, and new content is welcome. With that said, not everything fits inside the main library and some ideas are better done as *extension packages*. This may give your package more freedom and allows a faster development cycle and help keep ODL from overflowing with content.

There are several ways to extend ODL, some of which are listed below.

Adding Tensor spaces
--------------------
The abstract spaces `TensorSpace` and `TensorSet` are the workhorses of the ODL space machinery. They are used in both the discrete :math:`R^n` case, as well as data representation for discretized function spaces such as :math:`L^2([0, 1])` in the `DiscretizedSpace` class. These are in general created through the `rn` and `uniform_discr` functions who take an ``impl`` parameter, allowing users to select the backend to use.

In the core ODL package, there is only a single backend available: `NumpyTensorSpace`/`NumpyTensorSet`, given by ``impl='numpy'``, which is the default choice. Users can add CUDA support by installing the add-on library odlcuda_, which contains the additional spaces ``CudaFn``/``CudaNtuples``. By using the `rn`/`uniform_discr` functions, users can then seamlessly change the backend of their spaces.

As an advanced user, you may need to add additional spaces of this type that can be used inside ODL, perhaps to add MPI_ support. There are a few steps to do this:

* Create a new library with a ``setuptools`` installer.
* Add the spaces that you want to add to the library. The space needs to inherit from `TensorSet` or `TensorSpace`, respectively, and implement all of the abstract methods in those spaces. See the spaces for further information on the specific methods that need to be implemented.
* Add the methods ``tensor_set_impls()`` and ``tensor_space_impls()`` to a file ``odl_plugin.py`` in your library. These should return a ``dict`` mapping names to implementations.
* Add the following to your library's ``setup.py`` setup call: ``entry_points={'odl.space': ['odl_cuda = odlcuda.odl_plugin']``, where you replace ``odlcuda`` with the name of your plugin.
