"""Test that all examples run.

Running this file causes all examples to be run, and any exception will give
a FAILED result. All other results are considered PASSED.

Plots are displayed while the examples are run, but are closed after each
example. A user can, if he/she wants inspect the plots to further see if the
examples are OK.

This package assumes that all dependencies are installed.
