"""Nuclear norm minimization using the Douglas-Rachford solver.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_{x_1, x_2} ||x_1 - g_1||_2^2 + ||x_2 - g_2||_2^2 +
                   lam || [grad(x_1), grad(x_2)] ||_*

where ``grad`` is the spatial gradient, ``g`` the given noisy data and
``|| . ||_*`` is the nuclear norm.

The nuclear norm introduces a coupling between the channels, and hence we
expect that edges should coincide in the optimal solution.
