"""Total variation tomography using the Chambolle-Pock solver.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_x  1/2 ||A(x) - g||_2^2 + lam || |grad(x)| ||_1

Where ``A`` is a parallel beam forward projector, ``grad`` the spatial
gradient and ``g`` is given noisy data.

For further details and a description of the solution method used, see
:ref:`chambolle_pock` in the ODL documentation.
