"""Tomography with nuclear norm regularization.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_{0 <= x_1 <= 1, 0 <= x_2 <= 1}
        ||A(x_1) - g_1||_2^2 + 0.1 ||A(x_2) - g_2||_2^2 +
        lam || [grad(x_1), grad(x_2)] ||_*

where ``A`` is the ray transform,  ``grad`` is the spatial gradient,
``g_1``, ``g_2`` the given noisy data and ``|| . ||_*`` is the nuclear-norm.

The nuclear norm takes a vectorwise matrix norm, the spectral norm, i.e. the
p-norm of the singular values. It introduces a coupling between the terms
which allows better reconstructions by using the edge information from one term
in reconstructing the other term.

In this case we assume that ``g_2`` is much more noisy than ``g_1``, but we can
still get an acceptable reconstruction.

The data is assumed to be similar, but not exactly the same, for the channels.

Note that this is an advanced example.
