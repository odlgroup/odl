"""Solves the generalized Heron problem using the Douglas-Rachford solver.

The generalized Heron problem is defined as

    min_{x in R^2}  sum_i d(x, Omega_i),

where d(x, Omega_i) is the distance from x to the set Omega_i. Here, the
Omega_i are given by three rectangles.

This uses the infimal convolution option of the Douglas-Rachford solver since
the problem can be written as:

    min_{x in R^2}  sum_i inf_{z \in Omega_i} ||x - z||.
