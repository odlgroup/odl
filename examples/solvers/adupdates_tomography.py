r"""Total-variation regularized tomography example using the adupdates solver.

This example solves a linear inverse problem of the form :math:`Ax = y`, where
:math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n` is the (unknown) original image to be reconstructed,
:math:`y \in \mathbb{R}^m` is the noisy data and :math:`A \in \mathbb{R}^{m
\times n}` is the measurement matrix describing the discretized physical model.

To solve this problem, we first split the measurement matrix and the data into
:math:`m` parts and solve the least squares problem

..math::
    \min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n} D(x) := \sum_{j = 1}^m \| A_j x - y_j \|^2.

To regularize, we add terms for the total variation and for a functional which
guarantees that the solution will be pointwise nonnegative. The variational
regularization problem we are solving is therefore

..math::
    \min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n_+} D(x) + \sum_{i = 1}^d (\| \partial_{i, 1} x \|_1
    + \| \partial_{i, 2} x \|_1.

Here, :math:`\partial_{i, 1}` and :math:`\partial_{i, 2}` contain the even and
odd components, respectively, of the discretized :math:`i`-th partial
derivative, and :math:`d` is the dimension of the tomography problem. In this
example, :math:`d = 2`. We solve the problem with the alternating dual updates
method. For further details, see
`[MF2015] <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7271047/>`_.
