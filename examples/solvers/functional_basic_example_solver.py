"""Basic example on how to use the functional class together with solvers.

This file shows an example of how to set up and solve an optimization problem
using the default functionals. The problem we will solve is

    minimize 1/2 * ||x - g||_2^2 + lam*||x||_1,

for some vector g and some constant lam, subject to that all components in x
are greater than or equal to 0. The theoretical optimal solution to this
problem is

    x_opt = (g - lam)_+,

where ( )_+ denotes the positive part of the element, i.e.,
(z_i)_+ = max(z_i, 0).

# Note that with the values above, the optimal solution is given by a vector
# with first half of the elements equal to 0.5, the second half equal to 0.


# The problem will be solved using the forward-backward primal-dual algorithm.

# the indentity operator, and h = the squared l2-norm.
