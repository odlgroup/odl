"""Total variation sparse angle tomography using the Douglas-Rachford solver.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_{0 <= x <= 1, Ax = g} lam ||grad(x)||_x

where ``A`` is ray transform operator, ``g`` the given noisy data, ``grad`` is
the spatial gradient and || . ||_x is the so called cross-norm, giving rise to
isotropic Total Variation.

This problem can be rewritten in the form

    min_{0 <= x <= 1} lam ||grad(x)||_x + I_{Ax = g}

where I_{.} is the indicator function, which is zero if ``Ax = g`` and infinity
otherwise. This is a standard convex optimization problem that can
be solved with the `douglas_rachford_pd` solver.

In this example, the problem is solved with only 22 angles available, which is
highly under-sampled data. Despite this, we get a perfect reconstruction.
A filtered back-projection (pseudoinverse) reconstruction is also shown at the
end for comparsion.

This is an implementation of the "puzzling numerical experiment" in the seminal
paper "Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction from Highly
Incomplete Frequency Information", Candes et. al. 2006.

Note that the ``Ax = g`` condition can be relaxed to ``||Ax - g|| <= eps``
for some small ``eps`` in order to account for noise. This can be done using
the `IndicatorLpUnitBall` functional instead of `IndicatorZero`.
