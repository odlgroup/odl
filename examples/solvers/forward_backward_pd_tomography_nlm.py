"""NLM-TV tomography using the forward-backward primal dual solver.

Solves the optimization problem

    min_{0 <= x <= 1} ||A(x) - g||_2^2 + lam_1 TV(x) + lam_2 NLM(x)

where ``A`` is a ray transform, ``g`` the given noisy data ,
``TV`` total variation functional, and ``NLM`` is a Non-Local Means
regularizer. ``lam_1``, ``lam_2`` are regularization constants.

By using a combination of regularizers, a better result is achieved.
