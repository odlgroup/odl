def _add_default_complex_impl(fn):
    """Wrapper to call a real-valued class method twice when input is complex.

    This function helps `RayTransform` implementations with extending methods
    that work for real-valued elements to complex-valued elements, by splitting
    complex calls into two individual real calls.

    The wrapper will only work for methods of which the class provides a
    `vol_space` and `proj_space`. Typically, this will then work as a decorator
    on the method, e.g. ::

        @_add_default_complex_impl
        def call_forward(self, x, out=None, **kwargs):
            # Code that should run for real input and output

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : Callable
        Function with signature ``fn(self, x, out=None, **kwargs)``.
        ``self`` must be an object instance having ``self.vol_space`` and
        ``self.proj_space``.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A wrapper function to be executed by a Python decorator.
