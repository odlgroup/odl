"""Entry points for adding more spaces to ODL using external packages.

External packages can add implementations of `FnBase` by hooking into the
setuptools entry point ``'odl.space'`` and exposing the methods
``fn_impl_names`` and ``fn_impl``.

This is used with functions such as `rn`, `fn` and `uniform_discr` in order
to allow arbitrary implementations.
