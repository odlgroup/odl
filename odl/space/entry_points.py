"""Entry points for adding more spaces to ODL using external packages.

External packages can add implementations of `TensorSet` and
`TensorSpace` by hooking into the setuptools entry point ``'odl.space'``
and exposing the methods ``tensor_set_impls`` and ``tensor_space_impls``.


Attributes
----------
TENSOR_SET_IMPLS: dict
    A dictionary that maps a string to an `TensorSet` implementation.
TENSOR_SPACE_IMPLS: dict
    A dictionary that maps a string to a `TensorSpace` implementation.

Notes
-----
This is used with functions such as `rn`, `cn`, `tensor_space` or
`uniform_discr` in order to allow arbitrary implementations.
