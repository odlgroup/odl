def apply_on_boundary(array, func, only_once=True, which_boundaries=None,
                      axis_order=None, out=None):
    """Apply a function of the boundary of an n-dimensional array.

    All other values are preserved as is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array-like
        Modify the boundary of this array
    func : `callable` or `sequence`
        If a single function is given, assign
        ``array[slice] = func(array[slice])`` on the boundary slices,
        e.g. use ``lamda x: x / 2`` to divide values by 2.
        A sequence of functions is applied per axis separately. It
        must have length ``array.ndim`` and may consist of one function
        or a 2-tuple of functions per axis.
        `None` entries in a sequence cause the axis (side) to be
        skipped.
    only_once : `bool`, optional
        If `True`, ensure that each boundary point appears in exactly
        one slice. If ``func`` is a list of functions, the
        ``axis_order`` determines which functions are applied to nodes
        which appear in multiple slices, according to the principle
        "first-come, first-served".
    which_boundaries : `sequence`, optional
        If provided, this sequence determines per axis whether to
        apply the function at the boundaries in each axis. The entry
        in each axis may consist in a single `bool` or a 2-tuple of
        `bool`. In the latter case, the first tuple entry decides for
        the left, the second for the right boundary. The length of the
        sequence must be ``array.ndim``. `None` is interpreted as
        'all boundaries'.
    axis_order : `sequence` of `int`
        Permutation of ``range(array.ndim)`` defining the order in which
        to process the axes. If combined with ``only_once`` and a
        function list, this determines which function is evaluated in
        the points that are potentially processed multiple times.
    out : `numpy.ndarray`
        Location in which to store the result, can be the same as ``array``.
        Default: copy of ``array``

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> arr = np.ones((3, 3))
    >>> apply_on_boundary(arr, lambda x: x / 2)
    array([[ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  1. ,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5]])

    If called with ``only_once=False``, applies function repeatedly

    >>> apply_on_boundary(arr, lambda x: x / 2, only_once=False)
    array([[ 0.25,  0.5 ,  0.25],
           [ 0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.5 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.5 ,  0.25]])

    >>> apply_on_boundary(arr, lambda x: x / 2, only_once=True,
    ...                   which_boundaries=((True, False), True))
    array([[ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  1. ,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  1. ,  0.5]])

    Also accepts out parameter

    >>> out = np.empty_like(arr)
    >>> result = apply_on_boundary(arr, lambda x: x / 2, out=out)
    >>> result
    array([[ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  1. ,  0.5],
           [ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5]])
