import numpy as np

# This is supposed to be used as the `copy=AVOID_UNNECESSARY_COPY` argument to
# the `np.array` constructor when a copy is not desired but may not be avoidable
# (for example because a conversion to a different `dtype` is performed).
# ODL uses this in many places, since it gives usually good performance but
# also still offers flexibility.
# In NumPy-1, the `copy` argument could only be `True` or `False`, the latter
# being merely a request which NumPy-1 ignored if necessary.
# By contrast, NumPy-2 makes `False` binding: if a copy cannot be avoided,
# an error is raised. For the old weak request, NumPy-2 offers `copy=None`
# as the value, which is thus what ODL shall use forward-facing.
# NumPy-1 does however not understand this, which is why the following definition
# is needed for compatibility with both.
