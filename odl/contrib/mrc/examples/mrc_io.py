"""Example for the usage of the MRC reader/writer.

The code below first reads an existing MRC file from disk and prints
some attributes read from the header. If possible, the data is displayed.
Then, a new header is created using a utility function, and a new
(temporary) file is written to disk.

This simulates the start and end of a reconstruction workflow, where
first projection data is read from disk, and finally the reconstructed
volume is written back to disk, using a different header.
