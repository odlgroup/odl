def steepest_descent(grad, x, line_search, niter=1, partial=None):
    """Steepest descent method to minimize an objective function.

    General implementation of steepest decent (also known as gradient
    decent) for solving

        :math:`\min f(x)`

    The algorithm is intended for unconstrained problems. It needs line
    search in order guarantee convergence. With appropriate line search,
    it can also be used for constrained problems where one wants to
    minimize over some given set :math:`C`. This is done by defining
    :math:`f(x) = \infty` for :math:`x\\not\\in C`.


    The algorithm is described in [1]_, section 9.3--9.4
    (`book available online
    <http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf>`_),
    [2]_, Section 12.2, and wikipedia
    `Gradient_descent
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grad : `Operator`
        Gradient of the objective function,
        :math:`x \mapsto \\nabla f(x)`
    x : element in the domain of ``deriv``
        Starting point of the iteration
    line_search : `LineSearch`
        Strategy to choose the step length
    niter : `int`, optional
        Number of iterations
    partial : `Partial`, optional
        Object executing code per iteration, e.g. plotting each iterate
